## Kio estas Kuko? (What is Kuko?)

Kuko is a reusable game framework being built with C++, SDL2, and Lua.  The intention is to use it for cross-platform games (primarily Android, Windows, Linux, and Mac).

* Multiple language support, with languages stored in .lua file
* Simple UI functionality, with menu data stored in .lua file
* State management
* Asset management (graphics, fonts, audio)
* Input handling
* Core game entity objects, with entity manager.

**WIP:**

* Tiled map file support (partially implemented)
* Game saves and saving game config, in .lua files
* Remappable input, including keyboard, and location of on-screen controls for mobile  

## Projects using Kuko

* [Pickin' Sticks LXXIV](https://github.com/Moosader/Pickin-Sticks-LXXIV/)
* Language Village (Fantazio de Esperanto) - Early development (March 2015 - ?)

Future projects:
